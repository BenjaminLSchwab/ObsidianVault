## The War: Empire vs. Horde
![[WarArt.png]]
**[[The Holy Shard Empire]]** and **[[Urokgard]]** (the orcish horde) have been locked in generational conflict over the border city of **[[Passerelle]]**. Control of the city has changed hands a couple of times over the centuries. This latest war is just another chapter in an old, bitter story.

**Recent Events:**

- After a catastrophic disaster in Passerelle (see below), the Empire attempted to muster forces to retake the city.
- The campaign has been brutal and indecisive.
- Imperial forces have managed to raid and pillage several Urokgard settlements, but haven't secured lasting victories.
- The countryside between Empire and Horde territory is a war-torn no man's land.
- Deserters, refugees, and opportunists flow through the region.
- You likely passed through war-affected areas to reach the job meeting point. Perhaps you fled the conflict, profited from it, fought in it, or simply got caught in the crossfire. Imperial patrols, Horde raiding parties, and bandit gangs all operate in the region.

## The Passerelle Disaster
![[FirstCampaign.png]]
Three months ago, something unprecedented happened in the contested city of Passerelle.

**What Everyone Knows:**
- A massive serpent emerged from **[[Puteo's Swamp]]** to the south.
- It carved a path of destruction directly toward [[Passerelle]].
- Dozens of buildings were demolished, hundreds killed.
- An ancient Empire watchtower, dormant for centuries, suddenly activated.
- The tower fired a beam weapon of immense power, obliterating the serpent.
- The tower then self-destructed in a massive explosion.

**The Political Aftermath:**
- The Urokgard warlord claims his forces activated the tower and saved the city (though beam weapons aren't exactly orcish technology).
- Empire loyalists claim it proves the "ancients" still watch over Imperial lands, making it sacred territory.
- The disaster became a rallying cry for the Empire's attempt to retake the city.
- Investigators, scavengers, and opportunists have been swarming the disaster site.

## The Wastes

To the west lies a region known simply as **[[The Wastes]]**, a vast expanse of desert badlands, salt flats, and canyons that most civilized folk avoid.

**What You Might Know:**

- The Wastes are the ancestral homeland of the dragonborn.
- No nation controls it; the terrain itself keeps armies out.
- A few hardy souls live there, mostly in a settlement called **[[Vareth's Cut]]** hidden in the **[[The Newala Canyon]]**.
- Some seek meteor fragments known to have fallen here. They're valuable to collectors and wizards.
- It's an excellent place to disappear if you're running from something

## The Job
![[CaravanArt.png]]
The Adventurer's Guild has put out a contract to guard a caravan through the Wastes. 

**The Employer:**

- **Ronan Calesh**, a dragonborn.
- He operates out of a shack on the edge of civilized territory, where the plains meet the Wastes.
- Ronan has contracted with the Guild before. He's reliable, pays on time, no-nonsense.
- He specializes in difficult routes that most merchants won't risk.

**The Contract:**

- Guard duty for a caravan traveling through the Newala Canyon into the Wastes
- Destination: Vareth's Cut (a dragonborn settlement deep in the canyon)

**The Meeting Point:** You've been instructed to meet at Ronan's shack. Getting there likely meant traveling through war-torn countryside. Checkpoints, refugee camps, burned villages.
