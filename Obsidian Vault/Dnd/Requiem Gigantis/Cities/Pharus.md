### City Characteristics

- No Watchtower: The absence of a watchtower from [[The Holy Shard Empire]] era suggests that Pharus was not a strategic military location. The city developed more peacefully, focusing on trade and agriculture rather than defense.
    
- Stormy Climate: The city's location on a peninsula makes it prone to storms. This affects the city's culture, with stories of legendary storms, sea monsters, and brave sailors being popular among the locals.
    
- Economic Activities: The city hosts bustling docks where fishing boats and trading vessels come and go, a thriving marketplace, and workshops for crafting goods from local resources.
    
- Large Granary: It symbolizes Pharus' role as an agricultural hub and the [[Federation of Commerce and Harbors |Federation's]] investment in controlling food supplies. The granary is a massive structure, located near the docks for easy loading and unloading of grain shipments. Its gnomish architecture reflects both functionality and the Federation's power – robust, with advanced mechanisms for storing and dispensing measured quantities of grain.
