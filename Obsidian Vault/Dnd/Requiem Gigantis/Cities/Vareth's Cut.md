## Overview
Small oasis town in [[The Newala Canyon]], [[The Wastes]].
## Geography & Climate

Nestled in a rare deep canyon where an underground spring surfaces, creating a thin ribbon of green amid endless red rock. The water emerges from a crack in the canyon wall (the "Cut" itself—a vertical fissure said to be a claw mark from the first dragonborn). Summer temperatures reach lethal levels by midday; locals move only at dawn and dusk. Winter nights drop below freezing. Flash floods carve new paths through the canyon every few years, forcing constant rebuilding.

The oasis supports date palms, bitter scrub brush, and colonies of canyon lizards that locals trap for food and trade. Beyond the green belt, it's just stone, sand, and sky.

## Culture & Daily Life

**The Trap Lines** - Economic and social center of life. Families maintain ancestral trap territories in the canyon system, checking lines at dawn for lizards, snakes, cliff rats, and the occasional desert fox. Pelts and preserved meat are the only trade goods.

**Oral Tradition** - With no formal education and minimal literacy, history and law are passed down through sung stories in Draconic. The elders gather at the Cut itself each new moon to recite the lineages—who descended from which of the First Clutches.

**Water Rights** - The spring flows into a series of stone cisterns carved by ancestors. Each family gets allocated time to draw water based on complex hereditary rules. Water theft is punishable by exile (which usually means death in the Wastes).

**Architecture** - Lower structures are rammed earth with flat roofs where families sleep during hot months. Upper dwellings are carved directly into canyon walls, accessible by rope ladders and carved handholds. The oldest structures show evidence of claws being used before picks became the norm. 

## Social Structure

**The Clutch Mothers** - Eldest females of each bloodline hold authority. They arbitrate disputes, allocate water, and maintain the oral histories. Their word is law. There's no single leader—consensus among the Clutch Mothers governs the settlement.

**The Scaled** - Anyone born in Vareth's Cut, regardless of lineage. Fiercely proud, deeply suspicious of outsiders.

**The Soft-Skinned** - Rare non-dragonborn who've earned trust through years of residence. Still never fully accepted. Most don't stay.

**Exile-Marks** - If they somehow survive in the Wastes and return, they're invisible—no one speaks to them or acknowledges their existence, even family.

## Relationship with the Outside World

The Holy Shard Empire tried occupation twice in the 400's of the [[Fifth Age]]

- First attempt, garrison of 40 soldiers. Twelve dead from heat stroke in the first month. The rest driven out after their water rations were mysteriously poisoned with cactus toxin.
- Second attempt, "cultural integration" program with tax collectors and a Common language school. The Clutch Mothers smiled, nodded, and taught children to sabotage the census. After two years of bureaucratic frustration and no revenue, the Empire withdrew.
- It has been largely ignored by the empire ever since.
