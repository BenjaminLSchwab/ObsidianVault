### Description

- There lies the city of Quartum, a once-proud jewel of [[The Holy Shard Empire]], now an “independent city-state”  controlled by the [[Federation of Commerce and Harbors]].
    

- With each breath of its salty sea breeze, you also get a whiff of the cities many inhabitants
    
- Cobblestone streets, mostly wooden single story shacks form the outer areas, older two story buildings form the richer city center, with other larger buildings near the port.
    
- A port city of bustling activity, Quartum thrives on its trade like a heartbeat fueled by the rhythmic tides.
    

- Ships of many kinds in the harbor, mostly exporting grains and salted meats
    

## Abandoned watch tower
    

- a sentinel frozen in time, its once-proud purpose long forgotten by those who now pass it by. This weathered edifice, a relic of the empire's reach, rises out of the nearby forest
    
- The watchtower's architecture, though worn, still bears the elegant traces of a bygone era. Arched windows, now empty and hollow, once held prisms of vibrant colors that refracted sunlight into the eyes of the church
    
- Has become the nesting site for a family of griffons.
    

- Piles of discarded bones nearby
