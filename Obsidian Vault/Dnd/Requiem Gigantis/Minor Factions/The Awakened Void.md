## Overview
Founded in [[Vareth's Cut]] in 973
Led by [[The Mad Prophet of The Cut]]

## Visual Description
They dress in simple robes died red with clay from [[The Newala Canyon]] region. Their mission is simple, spread awakening of the message to as many people as possible. They infiltrate cities by being indistinguishable from a madman or a beggar. They have no possessions, and carry no weapons. In combat, they use martial arts, enhanced with blessings from the prophet. 

## Recruitment Methods

**The Broken Mirror Technique** Initiates approach potential converts in moments of crisis. Grief, financial ruin, existential dread. They don't offer comfort, instead they offer _liberation through annihilation_. "Your suffering exists because YOU exist. Unmake yourself and become free."

**Public Ego-Deaths** Followers stage dramatic public breakdowns in marketplaces and temples. Screaming revelations, tearing at their clothes, laughing and weeping simultaneously. They're calculated to plant seeds of doubt about reality itself. Onlookers often can't tell if they're witnessing madness or enlightenment, which is precisely the point.

**The Sleepwalker's Whisper** Awakened infiltrators work as servants, laborers, beggars, and altogether invisible people. They whisper fragments of Beale's philosophy to the stressed, the overworked, the overlooked: "You don't have to be this person anymore." "The gods made you their slave." "You could stop right now." Simple phrases that erode identity over time.

## Organizational Structure

**The First Shattered** - Beale's inner circle of five disciples who underwent ego-death directly under his guidance. They serve as regional prophets, each interpreting the message through their own lens of madness.

**The Void-Touched** - Fully initiated members who have completed their ego-shattering. They're eerily calm, speak in present-tense only, and seem to lack normal fear responses. They can't be intimidated or tortured effectively because they genuinely don't identify with their bodies.

**The Waking** - Newcomers still in the process of ego-dissolution. They're unstable, dangerous to themselves and others, often experiencing what outsiders would call psychotic breaks. The cult protects them during this vulnerable period.

**The Sleepers** - Secret sympathizers who maintain their old lives while slowly adopting the philosophy. These are the most dangerous—judges, merchants, guards who are beginning to question the nature of reality itself.

## Combat Philosophy

The Void-Touched don't fight to win; they fight to _demonstrate_.

**Techniques:**

- **The Unborn Stance**: They don't dodge or block reactively—they move as if they already know where attacks will land, creating an unnerving prescience
- **Flesh is Fiction**: They don't react to pain normally, continuing to fight with broken bones or severe wounds while maintaining unsettling eye contact
- **The Mirror Strike**: They mimic their opponent's fighting style perfectly after observing it briefly, as if to say "your techniques are just patterns anyone can copy"
## Sacred Practices

**Initiation** - In order to be accepted into the ranks of the faithful, they must undergo a process of shattering their own ego. This looks different for every individual but often involves acting completely crazy for months at a time. Once they have totally lost their sense of self, they will begin to serve the larger body of believers.

**The Dawn Dissolution** - Every sunrise, followers spend exactly 108 seconds staring at their reflection in water, then destroy it with a stone. "The face you see is not you. The face you remember is not you. There is no face."

**The Nameless Hours** - Periods where followers refuse to acknowledge their names or respond to them. They refer to themselves as "this one" or "the pattern speaking."

**Pilgrimage of Purposelessness** - Awakened members wander without destination, going wherever their feet take them, trusting that a person without ego cannot be in the wrong place.

## Why They Threaten the Underworld

The theology is devastatingly effective: if people achieve true ego-death before physical death, their souls become unanchored, not bound to any afterlife because there's no coherent self to receive judgment or destination. They don't go to the underworld; they don't go anywhere. They simply _stop defining themselves as separate from the cosmos_, creating a metaphysical void that even death gods cannot claim.

Beale's greatest heresy isn't denying the gods, it's making them _irrelevant_.
