![[Grul Ironfoot Portrait.png]]
**Age:** Late 20s
**Race:** Full orc
**Occupation:** Laborer, former Urokgard warrior (aged out)
### Visual Description

Tall and broad, classic orc physique, muscular but showing signs of old injuries. Green-gray skin with ritual scars across his arms and chest (traditional Urokgard warrior markings). Prominent tusks, one chipped from combat.

Wears simple laborers' clothes. reinforced trousers, heavy work shirt, sturdy boots. Carries minimal gear: bedroll, waterskin, a work knife (not a combat blade), and a small pouch with his few possessions.

Speaks Common with a heavy accent.
### Personality

**Gentle Despite Appearance:** Grul is soft-spoken, patient, and thoughtful—a stark contrast to what people expect from an orc warrior. Years of violence broke something in him; he genuinely wants peace now.

**Outsider Everywhere:** Too peaceful for the Horde, too orcish for human settlements. Exists in the gap between cultures, belonging nowhere.

**Tired:** Not physically, but soul-tired. The weariness of someone who's seen too much and just wants to live quietly.

**Defensive About His Past:** Won't talk about the war. Changes subject. Gets quiet and withdrawn if pressed. Not because he's hiding something sinister, but because the memories hurt.

**Helpful:** Offers to carry heavy loads, helps set up camp, volunteers for difficult tasks. Trying to prove he's not a threat, that he's useful, that people shouldn't fear him.

### Background

**The Warrior Years:** Served in Urokgard's armies during multiple campaigns against the Empire. Good soldier, followed orders, did terrible things because that's what warriors do. Survived battles that killed most of his war-band.

**The Breaking Point:** During a raid on an Imperial village, he was ordered to kill civilians. He did it—not because he wanted to, but because refusing meant death. The screams haunt him. He can still see their faces.

**The Discharge:** After the raid, he stopped functioning as a warrior. Couldn't sleep, couldn't fight effectively, questioned orders. His commander saw weakness and discharged him rather than waste resources on a broken soldier. No honor, no ceremony—just told to leave.

**The Wandering:** He's been drifting for over a year. Can't return to Urokgard (disgrace). Can't integrate into Imperial society (he's an orc who killed their people). Picks up labor jobs, saves money, moves on when people get too suspicious or hostile.

**The Dream:** Somewhere, somehow, he wants to find a place where people judge him for his actions now, not his species or past. Maybe the Wastes, maybe beyond. He's looking for redemption he's not sure exists.

### Why He's With the Caravan

- Heard Vareth's Cut is dragonborn territory—neutral ground, not Empire or Horde
- Hopes maybe dragonborn won't immediately assume he's dangerous
- Paid passage doing manual labor for Ronan (loading, unloading, maintaining gear)
- Plans to travel beyond the Wastes to orc steppe lands where maybe he can start over
- Ronan gave him a chance when others wouldn't—he's deeply grateful and loyal

### The Setup
**The Murder:**
- Garrett waits until Marcus is alone (night watch rotation, checking on goats, morning ablutions)
- Kills him quietly with his mace—quick, brutal, efficient
- Makes it look like a struggle

**The Frame:**

- Steals Grul's work knife earlier (Grul probably won't notice immediately—he's trusting)
- Leaves the knife near the body or plants it in Grul's belongings
- Creates evidence suggesting orcish violence: specific wound patterns, perhaps torn clothing suggesting a struggle with someone very strong
- Maybe smears some of Marcus's blood on Grul's bedroll or gear when no one's looking
- Could even plant a "motive"—claim he saw Marcus and Grul arguing (they didn't, but who's going to believe the orc?)

**The Accusation:** When the body is discovered, Garrett is the first to point at Grul:

- "An orc did this—look at the wounds!"
- "I knew we shouldn't have trusted him"
- "He was a warrior, he's killed before"
- Appeals to everyone's prejudices and fears

### The Investigation Challenge

The party must investigate and discover:

**Evidence Against Grul (Circumstantial):**

- His knife near/on the body
- He's an orc and former warrior
- He was in the area when Marcus died
- He has killed before (if they dig into his past)
- Some witnesses might have seen him near Marcus (innocent interactions misremembered)

**Evidence That Clears Grul:**

- Wrong wound patterns (mace vs. knife)
- Grul's knife is clean if examined carefully (or blood doesn't match if Garrett got sloppy)
- Grul has an alibi or his timeline doesn't work
- His personality doesn't match—he actively avoids violence
- He has no motive (Marcus barely spoke to him)

**Evidence Against Garrett:**

- He has clear motive (Marcus recognized him)
- His military training matches the kill style
- His mace could have made the wounds
- He was unusually interested in Grul's knife/possessions
- Witnesses saw him talking to Marcus, and Marcus seemed to be trying to remember something
- He's been paranoid and watching for Imperial patrols
- The Deserter has opportunity and training

### Roleplay Complications

**Grul's Reaction:** When accused, Grul doesn't fight back aggressively. He:

- Denies it quietly: "No. I not do this. I not kill anymore."
- Doesn't run (where would he go in the Wastes?)
- Accepts that people believe he did it—he's used to being blamed
- Might even say: "You kill me if you want. Probably deserve it for other things. But not this. Not this one."

This makes it harder—he's not acting like a guilty man trying to escape, but also not defending himself effectively.

**Garrett's Reaction:**

- Plays the concerned fellow traveler
- "I know it's hard to accept, but look at the evidence"
- Appeals to others' prejudices: "I've seen what orcs do in war..."
- If cornered, might try to paint himself as the hero protecting everyone from a dangerous killer
- Ultimate desperation: confess to desertion but claim self-defense against Marcus threatening to turn him in, then try to flee or fight
