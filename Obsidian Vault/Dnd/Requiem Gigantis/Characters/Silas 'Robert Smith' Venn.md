![[Silas 'Robert Smith' Venn Portrait.png]]
## Basic Information

**Name:** Silas "Robert Smith" Venn
**Age:** early 40s
**Race:** Halfling
**Class:** Rogue (Smuggler)
**Alignment:** Neutral

## Visual Description

The kind of face you forget five minutes after meeting. Average height, average build. Well-trimmed beard. Dresses like a merchant: decent quality clothes that don't stand out, practical boots, a traveler's cloak with many interior pockets.

His hands make quick, precise movements. Callused fingertips. A burn scar on his right palm. Always wearing leather gloves when the lead box is nearby.

Eyes constantly scanning, noting who's watching, calculating angles. Smiles easily but it never reaches his eyes. Carries himself with the relaxed confidence of someone who's talked their way out of worse situations.

The lead box is roughly 8x8x6 inches, sealed with a complex lock he keeps the key for on a chain under his shirt. Never lets it out of his sight. Sleeps with it under his bedroll, one hand always touching it.
## Personality & Mannerisms

**The Professional:**

- Smooth talker with a story for everything
- Deflects personal questions with jokes or counter-questions
- "Need to know basis, friend, and you don't need to know"
- Treats smuggling like a respectable trade—pride in his craft

**Paranoid Habits:**

- Checks behind constantly
- Varies his routine deliberately
- Never sits where he can be cornered
- Pays attention to who's asking questions about him
- Has multiple fake names and backstories ready

**The Criminal:**

- Knows thieves' cant and criminal networks across regions
- Can find black market contacts in any major settlement
- Understands the value of information and silence
- Respects other professionals, contempt for amateurs

**Stress Indicators:**

- Chain smokes a pipe when nervous (more than usual lately)
- Fingers drum on the lead box unconsciously
- Gets snappish when people get too close to his belongings
- Drinks to steady nerves but never enough to lose control

## Background & The FCH Connection

**The Organization:** Works for the [[The Lanterns]]. They have fingers in smuggling, information brokering, theft, and occasional killings. Regional headquarters somewhere in [[Pontis]].

**His Role:** Mid-level operative. Not muscle, not leadership. He's an acquisitions specialist. They point him at valuable items, he makes them disappear and reappear where they're supposed to be. Good at his job. Reliable. Discreet.

**The Mission:** Sent to the disaster site within days of the incident. Objectives:

1. Recover any magical items of value (especially mana batteries—extremely valuable, extremely illegal to possess.)
2. Destroy or remove anything linking the FCH to the site
3. Get out without being caught

**What Went Wrong:** He was careful, but authorities had the site locked down tighter than expected. A warrior chief spotted him near restricted areas. He couldn't bluff his way out. Too suspicious, wrong time, wrong place. Had to run. The orcs spotted him running with his precious cargo. He was able to make it out of the city and tried going south through the swamps. There he ran into an imperial checkpoint and got caught bribing his way through. He had to slit a soldier's throat to escape.

Now he's wanted by the [[Urokgard]] and the [[The Holy Shard Empire]]. His face might be on wanted posters. Local authorities are watching roads. He can't go back through normal channels. 

## The Lead Box & Its Contents

**The Mana Battery:** A crystalline gem roughly the size of a fist, pulsing with stored magical energy. These are artifacts from ancient ruins, extremely rare. This one is particularly potent. Enough stored power to level a city block or fuel a wizard's research for years.

**Why Lead?:** Mana batteries emit a faint magical signature detectable by trained mages or certain Imperial divination wards. Lead blocks magical detection. It also prevents accidental discharge if the crystal is jostled.

**The Problem:** Lead is heavy and suspicious. Anyone with arcane knowledge will immediately recognize what a lead box that size means. It's basically advertising "I'm carrying something very magical and very illegal."

**His Orders:** Get the battery to a FCH contact in [[Pontis]]. They'll pay him enough to retire comfortably. But first, he has to get out of the region without Imperial authorities catching him.

**Why the Wastes Route:** Desperate times. The main roads are being watched. Heading through the Wastes means no Imperial checkpoints, no authorities, just survival and bandits. Risky, but better than a noose.

## Why He's With the Caravan

Heard about a caravan heading through [[The Newala Canyon]] to [[Vareth's Cut]], then potentially beyond. Paid triple the normal passage fee, no questions asked. Claimed he's a spice merchant relocating inventory to avoid tariffs.

Keeps to himself but tries to seem friendly. Not so standoffish that people remember him, not so friendly they ask too many questions. Just another traveler with business elsewhere.

## Skills & Capabilities

**What He's Good At:**

- Lockpicking, trap detection, sleight of hand
- Lying convincingly with multiple layers of backup stories
- Reading people and situations
- Urban navigation and underworld contacts
- Appraising valuable items
- Basic alchemy (mostly for smoke bombs, acid, sleeping draughts)

**What He's Not:**

- Not a fighter—carries a concealed dagger and knows how to use it, but prefers running
- Not magically trained—can't actually use the mana battery, just transport it
- Not physically imposing—relies on speed and cunning

**In Combat:**

- Hides, uses cover, throws alchemical items
- Stabs people who aren't looking
- Escapes if possible
- Protects the lead box above all else—it's worth more than anyone's life
## Equipment

- **The Lead Box:** Locked, on a leather strap worn across his body, never removed
- **Thieves' Tools:** Hidden in various pockets, high quality
- **Concealed Dagger:** Sheath up his sleeve
- **Alchemical Items:** 2-3 smoke pellets, a vial of acid, sleep poison
- **Pipe & Tobacco:** Expensive blend, his one indulgence
