![[Karnessa Vale Portrait.png]]
## Overview
Race: Dwarf
Class: Oathbreaker Paladin
Role: Manager of Fighters
Alignment: Lawful Evil
Personality Keywords: Calculating, manipulative, fiercely loyal to “the Show”

## Description
Short but imposing, Karnessa wears bleached bone plate armor trimmed in silver. Her halo, once radiant, now flickers like a broken coin-light, and her eyes glow faintly red — remnants of divine heritage curdled by years under [[Veythar the Eternal|Veythar’s]] rule. Her voice is velvet-smooth but edged with command.

## Backstory
Once a holy warrior of The [[High Temple]], Karnessa fell in battle defending a doomed fortress. When her soul reached the underworld, Veythar offered her a bargain: eternal rest, or eternal purpose. She chose the latter — and became his fight manager.

## Motivation
Karnessa ensures the fights are dramatic yet balanced. She despises cowardice but rewards cunning. Though loyal to Veythar, she secretly dreams of earning her way out by orchestrating the “perfect fight”.

“I enforce the rules so His Majesty doesn’t have to. Trust me, mortal — you’d rather answer to me than him.”
