![[Thoggrin the Rebuilt Portrait.png]]
## Overview
Race: Undead (Ogre / Revenant Hybrid)
Class/Role: Barbarian / Arena Enforcer
Alignment: Neutral
Personality Keywords: Stoic, loyal, tragic

## Description
A hulking patchwork ogre with limbs of mismatched bone and sinew, reforged with glowing runes of command. His jaw is wired shut by gold staples, forcing him to communicate through low growls or gestures.

## Backstory
Thoggrin was once an arena champion in life, undefeated in mortal combat. When he fell in his final match, [[Veythar the Eternal|Veythar]] himself descended to claim his soul — impressed, not by his strength, but by his refusal to beg for mercy. Thoggrin was remade as [[The Pit]]’s enforcer, the one who drags rule-breakers back into the sand.

## Personality
He maintains the physical order of [[The Pit|the arena]] — raising gates, calming riots, and executing cheaters. Yet, deep inside, fragments of his mortal memory whisper of lost honor. Occasionally, he defies orders to protect a fighter who reminds him of himself.
