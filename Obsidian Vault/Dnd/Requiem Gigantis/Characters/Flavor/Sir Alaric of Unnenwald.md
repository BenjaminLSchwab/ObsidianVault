![[Sir Alaric of Unnenwald Portrait.png]]
## Description
A tall, broad man in dented plate. His armor glows faintly from within, like embers under ash. His face is pale and half-faded, his eyes twin lanterns of stubborn light.

## Backstory
Alaric died in a cavalry charge, fighting the [[Urokgard]] in the plains near east of [[Unnenwald]]. No one came to bury him. No rites, no temple bells, no passage to the Hall of Radiance.
Without a proper burial, his soul drifted until it fell into [[The Pit]], the resting place of the forgotten dead.

He cannot accept it. He believes there’s been a mistake. [[The Holy Shard Empire]] must still stand, the Temple must still remember him. Every day, he waits to wake from the nightmare.

## Personality

Ideal: Honor never dies.

Flaw: Cannot accept his own death.

Mannerism: Salutes when addressed, even by guards or shades.

Tone: Polite, firm, increasingly desperate.

## Example Dialogue

“It must be some mistake. I’m a knight of the Shard.”

“The light endures. It must.”

“If this is the afterlife, then let it see me stand.”

“I failed them once. I won’t fail again.”
