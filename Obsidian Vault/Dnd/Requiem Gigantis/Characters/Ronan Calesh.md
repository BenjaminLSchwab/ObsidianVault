![[Ronan Calesh Portrait.png]]
### Description:
Ronan stands just over six feet, lean and sinewy from years spent under a merciless sun. His skin is sunbaked and tough as tanned hide. A faint iridescent shimmer betrays the dragon’s blood in him, scales glinting along his jawline and down the sides of his neck. His eyes are a washed gold. When he smiles, faint serrations show on his teeth.

He wears a wide-brimmed hat and a long coat of tattered canvas reinforced with strips of scaled leather—spoils from creatures that stalk the wastes. His left arm rests in a crude splint, the result of his last misadventure. The arm hasn’t healed right, and he moves it stiffly.

### **Backstory:**

Ronan was born in the isolated town of [[Vareth’s Cut]]  His mother, **Alira Calesh**, was a human scholar from the Holy Shard’s borderlands; his father, a dragonborn trapper who vanished into [[The Newala Canyon]] one season and never came back.

He grew up listening to stories of Titans and gods, of the canyon’s moods and hungers. When the dragonborn children mocked his human looks, he spent his days alone in the wastes, learning the lay of the land, mapping dry wells and echoing caves. As he grew, he became a guide for caravans and monster hunters seeking rare pelts.

But the canyon demands tribute. His last job—an escort for a merchant lord’s expedition—ended in disaster: a rockslide, three guards crushed, and Ronan’s left arm broken clean through. Since then, he’s limped through life on grit and superstition, convinced the canyon is _alive_—an ancient, whispering thing that remembers debts and settles them slow.

### **Personality & Traits:**

- **Speech:** Drawls like a desert drifter; slow, deliberate, with a dust-dry humor. Calls strangers “partner” or “traveler.”
    
- **Beliefs:** Thinks every living thing owes something to the land that bore it. He leaves offerings at the canyon’s edge before each trek.
    
- **Fear:** Secretly believes his blood—his human heritage—is cursed, that it’s why the canyon keeps taking from him.
    
- **Quirk:** Speaks of the canyon as a living being.
    
- **Motivation:** Keeps guiding others into the wastes not for coin, but to listen—to see if the canyon will finally _speak back_.
