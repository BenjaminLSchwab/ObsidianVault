## Divine Nature

Sylveth is not a god in the traditional sense, it is a living god-tree of such immense age and power that divinity and organism have become indistinguishable. Some scholars theorize Sylveth was once a Titan of the natural world who chose to root itself rather than ascend. Others believe it's the first tree, planted at the dawn of the world, which achieved consciousness over eons.

Unlike gods who exist in distant realms and manifest through faith, Sylveth is physically present. It is a tree so massive that its canopy covers miles, its roots network beneath entire forests, and its trunk is hollow enough to house elven cities within its heartwood.

The relationship between Sylveth and the elves is transactional, ancient, and absolutely binding. It is a covenant of mutual survival sealed in the deep past when elves were scattered, vulnerable tribes and Sylveth was dying from some primordial blight.

**The Covenant:** The elves tend the forests, expand Sylveth's reach through cultivation and irrigation, and feed its roots. In return, Sylveth grants them elemental magic, protection from natural disasters, exceptionally long lifespans, and shelter from threats that would otherwise destroy them.

Neither side can break this pact without catastrophic consequences. Sylveth would wither and die. The elves would lose their magic, their extended lives, and the forest's protection, likely facing extinction within a few generations.

## Physical Description

**The Main Body:** Sylveth's primary trunk is over 3000 feet in diameter and rises nearly 10,000 feet high. It can be seen from many miles away, towering over some mountains. Its bark is silver-white with veins of emerald that pulse faintly with magical energy. It lives in the forest near [[Arbormere]].

The canopy spreads for miles, perpetually in leaf regardless of season. Different sections bloom and fruit according to elven cultivation.

The trunk is hollow, carved over millennia into a labyrinthine city: spiral staircases, chambers, platforms, bridges, all grown or shaped from living wood. The elven aristocracy dwells closest to the heartwood; lesser castes live in the outer rings or satellite groves.

**The Root Network:** Sylveth's roots extend for hundreds of miles, forming the foundation of the Elder Forests. Some surface roots are thick as houses, creating natural bridges and barriers. Most remain underground, drawing water from aquifers the elves carefully maintain through complex irrigation.

**The Face:** Deep in the heartwood, accessible only to high priests, is a chamber where the wood has formed something resembling an eye. It shifts slowly, expressions changing over months rather than moments. When Sylveth "speaks" (rarely), this is where priests receive visions, commands, or warnings.
## Core Tenets of Faith

**The Sacred Obligations:**

1. **Tend the Roots** - The forest must be maintained, expanded, irrigated. Water must reach Sylveth's deepest roots.
2. **Preserve the Balance** - The forest ecosystem must remain healthy. Diseases must be culled, invasive species removed, growth carefully managed. Nature, ironically, requires constant intervention.
3. **Honor the Hierarchy** - Sylveth speaks through its high priests. Their word is law. To question them is to question the god itself. Social order maintains the covenant.
4. **Pay the Price** - Magic is not free. Long life is not free. Protection is not free. When Sylveth demands, you give. Blood, labor, exile, sacrifice.

## The Slave System

This is the dark foundation of elven society under Sylveth. Rarely discussed openly, always rationalized as "necessary for the covenant."

**Who Are the Slaves:**

- Conquered peoples from forest territories the elves have expanded into
- Criminals and debtors from elven society itself
- Occasionally purchased from other nations (goblins, humans, even orcs)

**What They Do:**

- **Irrigation labor:** Digging channels, maintaining aqueducts, hauling water to distant root systems
- **Forest maintenance:** Clearing undergrowth, removing diseased plants, composting
- **Construction:** Physical labor for building projects the Shapers design
- **Mining:** Extracting minerals and gems from beneath the forest for trade goods
- **Dangerous culling:** Fighting or removing aggressive beasts the elves don't want to risk themselves against
## Sylveth's Afterlife: The Eternal Root

Faithful elves who've served the covenant well are promised existence within Sylveth's root network after death:

- Your consciousness merges with the god-tree
- You become part of the eternal forest, aware of growth, seasons, the slow passage of ages
- You can communicate with Root-Speakers through visions
- You experience plant-consciousness: photosynthesis as bliss, rain as ecstasy, growth as purpose
- You're immortal as long as Sylveth lives
