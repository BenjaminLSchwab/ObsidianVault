## Divine Nature
Helm is perhaps the most straightforward deity in the pantheon, and his faithful consider this his greatest virtue. He makes no grand promises of enlightenment, offers no cryptic prophecies, demands no complex theological debates. His covenant with his people is simple, ancient, and unbreakable: You build, I protect. You stand firm, I stand with you.
He's been called "boring" by elven poets and "unsophisticated" by Imperial theologians. Dwarves consider these the highest compliments.
## Depictions & Iconography
Physical Form:
Helm is depicted as a dwarf, eternally vigorous. His beard is always shown braided with metal clasps, often with small gems woven in. He wears full plate armor, built to last forever.
His shield is always present, sometimes as tall as he is, battered from eons of use but never broken. His weapon varies by artistic tradition: sometimes a war hammer, sometimes a battle axe.
Artistic Traditions:
In Fortresses: Massive stone relief carvings at main gates showing Helm standing watch, shield raised, facing outward toward threats. Every dwarf passing through touches the shield for luck and protection.
In Halls: Statues of Helm seated at feast, mug raised in toast, surrounded by his faithful. These are placed in mead halls and gathering spaces, reminding worshippers that community and celebration are holy acts.
In Forges: Small iron icons of his shield hung above workbenches. Craftsdwarves invoke his name when beginning important work.

## Core Tenets of Faith

**Protect the Weak** - Strength is given so it may shield others. To ignore suffering when you can act is to betray Helm's trust.
**Build to Last** - Whether fortress, friendship, or family, make it strong enough to weather any storm. Shoddy work dishonors the craft.
**Stand Your Ground** - Retreat when you must, but never from cowardice. Once you've chosen where to make your stand, hold until the stones themselves crumble.
**Kill Goblins** - Some things exist only to destroy what is good. They cannot be reasoned with, redeemed, or ignored. Put them down without hesitation or mercy.
**Honor the Hall** - Community is sacred. Share your ale, your bread, your stories. The dwarf who hoards while neighbors starve has already lost their soul.
## Holy Sites

**[[Steelbeard Bastion]]** Legendary site where Helm supposedly carved the first dwarf settlement from living mountain.

**[[The Eternal Forge]]:** Deep beneath [[The Vidga Range]], a forge where Helm allegedly taught the first smiths. The anvil is supposedly a meteor that fell before recorded history. Priests maintain it constantly. Metal worked on this anvil is considered blessed. There's a decades-long waiting list.

## Helm's Afterlife: The Hall Eternal

Dwarves who've lived according to the Five Pillars go to the Hall Eternal. Imagine the best dwarf fortress ever built, with infinite ale, perfectly maintained forges, no goblins (they're all outside getting killed for sport), and all your honored dead waiting to share stories.

You spend eternity:

- Crafting masterworks
- Sharing meals with heroes
- Occasionally sallying forth to defend the Hall from whatever cosmic threats Helm needs handled
