## Visual Description
Beale's crimson scales are dulled by dust and ascetic neglect. He considers grooming a vanity of the sleeping mind. His bright blue eyes bore through listeners with an unsettling mixture of fury and desperate compassion, as if he's simultaneously enraged by their ignorance and heartbroken that they don't understand their own divinity.
His cattail-fiber robe hangs asymmetrically, one shoulder always exposed in deliberate rejection of symmetry. Ritual scars crisscross his forearms, self-inflicted during his own ego-death. His claws are worn down to nubs from years of prostrating himself on stone, and his voice carries a raspy, worn quality from decades of ecstatic preaching.
When he speaks, spittle flies. His hands gesticulate wildly, sometimes striking his own chest or head with alarming force. He paces, stalks, occasionally drops to all fours. His sermons are performances of controlled madness, demonstrating the very dissolution of self he preaches.

## His Message
Freedom, awakening, conscious awareness of the present moment. His message teeters on the edge of breaking the fourth wall. He makes the crowds aware that they are just puppets being controlled by larger forces. He is angry at the gods. He is awake to the fact that ay any moment we can all cast off our chains of ego and stare directly into the void. One mustn't go to the underworld if one shatters their sense of self so completely that they no longer have a soul. They can't die because they were never born. They were never anything other than a pattern of energy that can recognize itself in the mirror. They were never born because they were already written into fate from the very beginning of time. They don't belong to God because they are all little pieces of God that have forgotten where they are from and what they are made of. But they can wake up at any moment. "Right now! Stop listening to my words and simply hear the sound right now! You have everything you need for enlightenment right now! Forget the gods! The gods are dead the moment you stop thinking about them! Your inheritance is the entire cosmos and you needn't wait for anyone to die to take it."
