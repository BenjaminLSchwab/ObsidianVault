## Description
Veythar appears as a towering figure draped in a gambler’s finery blended with funereal elegance. He wears a black velvet coat lined in silver filigree, a high collar, and a wide-brimmed hat usually shadowing his eyes. His eyes burn with pale gold fire. When he smiles, it’s with teeth like cut obsidian. He is the ruler of [[The Underworld]]

## Backstory
For centuries he waged war across every necrotic plane until even the other gods of death bent knee or withdrew. When at last the dust settled, Veythar stood alone, the undisputed Pit Boss of the Dead. 
A divine pact was forged: in exchange for not meddling in mortal life, he would be the default destination for all souls unclaimed by other gods. This truce has lasted through the [[Fifth Age]] — though few trust that his ambition is truly dormant.

## Personality
Showman of the End: Every action is dramatic. Veythar delights in flourish — grand speeches, wagers, and challenges. To him, eternity should never be dull.

Charming but Cruel: He’ll offer mercy in one breath and laugh at your downfall in the next.

Bound by Pact: He cannot act directly in the mortal realm, but he manipulates events through wagers with other gods, pacts with necromancers, and tournaments held in the dreamscapes of the dying.

Loves Risk: He admires mortals who take gambles with their lives — heroes, assassins, gamblers, and fools alike.

Despises Stagnation: He sees undeath (lichdom, vampires, etc.) as cheating the table. Such beings often become his personal targets of ridicule or punishment.
