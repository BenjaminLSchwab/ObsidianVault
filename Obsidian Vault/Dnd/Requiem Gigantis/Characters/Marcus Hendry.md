![[Marcus Hendry Portrait.png]]
**Age:** Mid-50s
**Race:** Human
**Occupation:** Former Imperial supply quartermaster (retired)
**Hometown:** Near Passerelle, in Imperial territory

### Visual Description

Graying hair, weathered face with a drinker's ruddy complexion. Pot-bellied from years of sedentary work and good rations. Wears civilian clothes now but still carries himself with that bureaucratic authority. The kind of man used to being obeyed by lower ranks.

Deep-set eyes that don't miss much. The kind of person who remembers faces and names from years ago. Habit of pointing when he talks.

Travels with a walking stick (bad knee from an old injury), a heavy pack with more belongings than practical for desert travel, and a leather-bound ledger he constantly references. Old quartermaster habits die hard.

### Personality

**Officious and Self-Important:** Even in retirement, he acts like he outranks everyone. Corrects people. Lectures about "proper procedure." Treats younger people like subordinates.

**Gossip:** Loves knowing things about people. Collects information the way he used to collect supply manifests. Will casually mention he "knows so-and-so from such-and-such."

**Surprisingly Sharp:** Despite seeming like a blowhard, he genuinely has a good memory for faces, names, and connections. Thirty years of tracking soldiers, supplies, and logistics trained him to notice details.

**Nervous Energy:** Talks too much, especially when anxious. The kind of person who fills silence with chatter. Makes "helpful" suggestions nobody asked for.

### Background

Spent thirty years as an Imperial quartermaster stationed in various border forts and supply depots. Knew hundreds of soldiers by name and face. His job required tracking who got what equipment, which units were where, who was rotating in and out.

Retired two years ago with a small pension. Has been traveling, visiting old friends from his service days, generally being a busybody. Was in [[Passerelle]] when the disaster struck, fled with other refugees.

Now trying to reach distant family in [[Sanctum]]. Heard the Wastes route had less Imperial oversight (he's carrying some "acquired" goods from his quartermaster days. Nothing major, but enough he'd rather avoid official checkpoints).

### The Recognition

Marcus would have processed equipment requisitions or supply distributions at a fort where [[Garrett Moss]] was stationed. Probably:

- Issued Garrett boots or winter gear
- Checked his unit in or out during rotations
- Had some bureaucratic interaction multiple times over months

He wouldn't know Garrett personally, but he'd recognize the face, remember the unit, and—crucially—know when Garrett should have rotated back. When someone doesn't return from deployment, quartermasters notice. Records get updated. Desertion gets flagged.

### The Fatal Conversation

Early in the journey, Marcus makes small talk with Garrett. Something clicks.

**Marcus:** "You know, you look familiar. Did you serve in the northern campaigns? I was quartermaster at Fort Maximus... wait, don't tell me... You were with the Third Infantry, weren't you? What was the name... started with an M? Or was it a G?"

He's not suspicious yet, just making conversation. But his tone suggests he's going to keep picking at this thread until he remembers. And once he remembers the name and that the desertion flag was raised...
### Why He's With the Caravan

- Fleeing Passerelle disaster, heading to family in Sanctum
- Chose the Wastes route to avoid Imperial checkpoints (carrying some "retired" quartermaster supplies he shouldn't have)
- Paid standard passage rate
- Has been annoying everyone with unsolicited advice and constant chatter
