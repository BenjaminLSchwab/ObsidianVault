## Basic Information

**Age:** 28
**Race:** Human
**Class:** Fighter 
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good (believes in doing right, no longer believes in following orders)
## Visual Description

Sun-weathered skin from farmwork and campaign marches. Shaggy brown hair he cuts himself with a knife—uneven and practical. Several days of stubble he can't quite commit to shaving or growing out. Pale scar across his left eyebrow from a spear thrust that nearly took his eye. Calloused hands. Lean build of someone who works, not someone who trains.

Wears a patchwork of gear: Imperial-issue boots, civilian trousers, a faded red shirt, and a weathered leather vest. His mace and shield are military equipment he should have turned them in but didn't. The shield still bears a partially scraped-off [[The Holy Shard Empire |Empire]] emblem he tried to remove with a rock.

Moves with a controlled economy of motion, always aware of exits. Sits with his back to walls. Flinches at loud noises but tries to hide it.
## Personality & Mannerisms

**The Cowboy Edge:** Quick with dry humor when he's comfortable. Calls people "friend" or "partner" sarcastically when annoyed. Spits when making a point. Rolls cigarettes from dried wasteland scrub. It tastes terrible but calms his nerves. Has a beat-up harmonica he plays badly during night watches.

**Combat Trauma Indicators:**

- Goes silent and still when he dissociates, staring at nothing.
- His hand unconsciously moves to his mace when startled.
- Struggles with sleep. The party will notice him on watch more than his fair share.
- Overreacts to sudden movements, especially from orcs or half-orcs.
- Sometimes responds to questions with "Sir, yes sir" before catching himself.

**Trust Issues:**

- Slow to open up but fiercely loyal once he does
- Sees authority figures as liars until proven otherwise
- Questions orders and wants to know "why" before committing
- Protective of civilians—that farm boy instinct remains

**The Cracks Showing:**

- Drinks more than he should when alcohol is available
- Gets agitated when people talk about "duty" or "honor"
- Refuses to discuss what he saw or did in the war
- Sometimes talks to himself, arguing with memories

## Background & History

**The Farm:** Grew up outside [[Passerelle]] on a grain farm. Third son, so no inheritance coming. Joined the Imperial army at 19 for steady pay and adventure. Sent money home religiously for six years.

**The Campaigns:** Fought in the northern territories against orc clans. Three major battles, dozens of skirmishes. Saw things that broke his understanding of warfare as noble or just:

- A village burned as "strategic denial"—he heard the civilians inside
- Prisoners executed because the column couldn't spare guards
- Saw human civilians slaughtered in the aftermath of an orc raid.
- Ordered to hold a position that was tactically pointless, costing sixteen men for nothing

**The Breaking Point:** After the third major battle (a brutal siege where both sides committed atrocities), he was ordered to join an execution detail for captured orc warriors. He refused. His sergeant put a sword to his throat. He knocked the sergeant unconscious, took his gear, and ran.

**The Desertion:** Six months on the run. The Empire executes deserters publicly as examples. He's traveled south through the plains, picking up work as caravan muscle, always moving, never using his real name. Heard the Wastes are a good place to disappear—no Imperial authority, nothing worth sending bounty hunters after.

## Combat Style

**Defensive Fighter:** Years of formation combat trained him to hold a line. Uses shield expertly—covering himself and allies. His mace technique is brutal and efficient, no flourishes. Aims for disabling strikes: knees, weapon arms, shield hands.

**Battle Discipline:** Despite his trauma, combat training is muscle memory. He's effective and reliable in a fight, almost mechanical. It's afterward when he falls apart.

**Tactical Mind:** Understands terrain, positioning, and when to retreat. Will argue against stupid plans—he's seen too many men die from officer pride.

**The Orc Problem:** If the party includes orc or half-orc members, he's professionally courteous but obviously uncomfortable. Gives them wide berth. Watches them more than others. Might volunteer for watch shifts that don't overlap with theirs. This creates party tension that needs addressing through roleplay.

## Why He's With the Caravan

Needs to get out of empire territory, and needs the money. This mission seems like a win win and a good way to lay low. Luckily [[Ronan Calesh|Ronan]] didn't ask too many questions.

## Equipment Notes

- **Mace:** Standard Imperial infantry issue, weighted head, scratched and dented
- **Shield:** Round shield, wooden with iron rim, that partially removed emblem
- **Armor:** Leather vest, no helmet (sold it for food weeks ago)
- **Personal Items:** Harmonica, tobacco pouch, flint and steel, bedroll, waterskin, a few coins
- **Hidden:** A letter from his mother he's never opened, arrived after he deserted

## Secrets the Party Might Discover

- Why he specifically doesn't trust orcs 
- He's functionally illiterate—can sign his name but not much else
- He's terrified of being recognized and dragged back in chains
