## Geography & Terrain

A vast expanse of broken badlands, salt flats, and wind-carved canyons. The Newala Canyon system cuts through the heart like a massive scar, with [[Vareth's Cut]] hidden in its depths.

**Major Features:**

**The Glass Fields** - Northern sector where meteor impacts superheated sand into sheets of black glass. Razor-sharp shards protrude at angles, making travel treacherous.

**The Salted Earth** - Eastern expanse of cracked white salt flats. Nothing grows. Ancient lake beds baked into alkaline deserts. Crossing requires multiple days without shade or water sources.

**The Craters** - Scattered impact sites, some over a mile wide. A few contain fragments of the meteors. Strange metallic stone that never rusts and holds heat for days. Treasure hunters brave the Wastes seeking these fragments, which fetch enormous prices from Imperial forges and wizard academies.

[[The Newala Canyon]] - The only place where underground aquifers reach the surface, creating a network of seasonal streams and rare oases. Most dry up by mid-summer except Vareth's Cut.

**The Dust Seas** - Western regions where wind has ground rock into fine red powder that drifts in dunes like water. Dust storms rise without warning, stripping flesh from bone. Travelers wrap themselves completely and navigate by the Vidga peaks when visibility allows.

## Climate & Conditions

Daytime temperatures regularly exceed 115°F in summer. Winter nights drop to freezing. Zero cloud cover means extreme temperature swings. Annual rainfall: less than 2 inches, usually in brief violent storms that cause flash flooding.

Wind is constant, the Wastes act as a thermal funnel between the cooler [[Vidga mountains]] and warmer southern plains.
## History
The wastes were marked by an intense meteor shower that destroyed almost all life in an already arid region. This event is known as [[The Night The Stars Fell]].
