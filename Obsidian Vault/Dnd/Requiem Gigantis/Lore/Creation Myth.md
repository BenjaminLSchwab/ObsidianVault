Each age is about 2000 yrs.

[[First Age]]: The age of [[Titans]] and Elder Forests
Long before the ancestors of man emerged from their caves, Titans ruled the earth. Tall enough to touch the stars; It is said that the Titans could speak without opening their mouths. They could create canyons with their plows. They knew no fear of death, and had mastery over all the beasts of the land. As they multiplied they drank up all the rivers, ate all the game, and fouled the air with smoke. They angered nature.

[[Second Age]]: A great war between Titans and the Sea and the Sky and the Earth
Many titans perished. A few escaped this realm, ascending to godhood. Before they left, they gave the gift of knowledge to the Ancestors of Man.

[[Third Age]]: The Golden Age of [[The Ancients]]
The Ancestors of Man emerged from the caves and inherited the land. Civilization flourished. The great races spread far and wide and become different from each other. Cities of gold could be built with their riches. Their mastery of magic accelerated beyond anything known to the great races today. Their hubris angered nature.

[[Fourth Age]]: The Second Upheaval
Man learned the forbidden knowledge of all things. A great cataclysm nearly destroyed the earth. The great races forgot most of what they knew. Their children survived by becoming like animals. This is when the elves made their pact with the elder trees, which is still upheld by the [[Larrel Sovereignty]].

[[Fifth Age]]: The Rebirth of Order
Nature’s rage subsided, and the seeds of civilization were allowed to sprout once more. Around two hundred years into the Fifth Age, the [[Holy Shard Empire]] was formed, and soon conquered much of the continent.

Our story begins in the year 973 of the Fifth Age. The Holy Shard Empire is waning. It has lost territory in every war for the past hundred years. Much of that territory was gained by the [[Urokgard]], as the great horde seeks to settle and make its mark on history. 
The elves maintain their pact as ever, but a paranoid Sovereign and the seductive promise of wealth through trade threatens the stability of their ancient state. 
The Federation of Commerce and Harbors has had a meteoric rise to power in the southern seas, amassing great fortune. Many whisper that they tempt fate with their avarice.
